    "# Introduction to Structured Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook introduces Structured Outputs, a new capability in the Chat Completions API and Assistants API that allows to get outputs to follow a strict schema, and illustrates this capability with a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured outputs can be enabled by setting the parameter `strict: true` in an API call with either a defined response format or function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Response format usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, the `response_format` parameter was only available to specify that the model should return a valid json.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, we are introducing a new way of specifying which json schema to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function call usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calling remains similar, but with the new parameter `strict: true`, you can now ensure that the schema provided for the functions is strictly followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways Structured Outputs can be useful, as you can rely on the outputs following a constrained schema needed for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you used JSON mode or function calls before, you can think of Structured Outputs as a foolproof version of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can enable more robust flows in production-level applications, whether you are relying on function calls or expecting the output to follow a pre-defined structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example use cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting structured answers to display them in a specific way in a UI (cf example 1 in this cookbook)\n",
    "- Populating a database with extracted content from documents or scrapped web pages (cf example 2 in this cookbook)\n",
    "- Extracting entities from a user input to call tools with defined parameters (cf example 3 in this cookbook)\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, anything that requires fetching data, taking action, or that builds upon complex workflows could benefit from using Structured Outputs."

      "- Convolutional Layers: These layers apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.\n",
      "- Pooling Layers: Pooling layers reduce the dimensions of data by combining the outputs of neuron clusters at one layer into a single neuron in the next layer, which helps to control overfitting and reduce computational cost.\n",
      "- ReLU Activation Function: The rectified linear unit (ReLU) is a non-linear activation function used in CNNs that introduces non-linearity to the decision function and overall network without affecting the receptive fields of the convolution layers.\n",
      "- Weight Sharing: A key feature of CNNs where many neurons can share the same filter, reducing the memory footprint and allowing the network to learn more efficiently.\n",
      "- Applications: CNNs are widely used in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, medical image analysis, and natural language processing.\n",

      "Description: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks primarily used for analyzing visual imagery. They are inspired by biological processes and are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images through backpropagation, using a structure that includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.\n",
