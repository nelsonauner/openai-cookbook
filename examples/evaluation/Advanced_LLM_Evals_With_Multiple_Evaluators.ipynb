      "    I recently had the pleasure of visiting Hawaii and it quickly became one of my favorite places. From the stunning beaches to the lush mountains, this place has it all. The people are incredibly friendly and the culture is alive and well. One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the Polynesian Cultural Center. Here, I was able to learn about the culture of the native Hawaiian people and try my hand at traditional crafts and activities. I also had a chance to explore some of the natural wonders of the island, including the breathtaking Hanauma Bay and the majestic Waimea Canyon. Whether you’re looking for a relaxing beach vacation or an adventure filled with culture and nature, Hawaii is the perfect destination.\n",

      "Experience Traditional Hawaiian Culture on Oahu\n",
      "\n",
      "No trip to Hawaii is complete without learning about the rich traditional Hawaiian culture. On Oahu, I visited the Polynesian Cultural Center, where I learned to hula dance, watched dramatic fire knife dancing performances, and took a canoe ride along a tropical river. I also toured ‘Iolani Palace, the only official royal residence in the U.S. and a National Historic Landmark. The palace provides insight into Hawaii's monarchy era in the late 19th century.\n",

      "Marvel at Massive Volcanoes on the Big Island \n",
      "\n",
      "The Big Island of Hawaii is a geologic wonderland, home to massive active volcanoes. I toured Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where I hiked to the rim of the Kilauea caldera and saw the dramatic cliffs and craters of this active volcano. At night, the glow from the caldera illuminated the sky. I also visited massive Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano, where stargazing at the summit visitor center is spectacular due to the clear, high-altitude air. \n",
      "\n",
      "Relax on Pristine Beaches on Maui\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hawaiian islands are home to some of the most stunning beaches in the world, and Maui has a beach for every taste. I enjoyed the black sand beaches and massive sea cliffs of Waianapanapa State Park. For a quintessential Hawaiian beach scene, head to Makena Beach, also known as “Big Beach.” The wide golden sand beach is flanked by swaying palm trees and the turquoise waters of the Pacific. For a quieter beach, check out the red sand beach at Kaihalulu. The dramatic cliffs and sand provide a perfect backdrop for a peaceful beach day.\n",

    "The traditional consensus score is a simple and easy-to-understand method for combining multiple evaluators. However, it does not take into account the quality of the judges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, the CROWDLAB multiannotator algorithm estimates annotator quality but is dependant on the quality of the provided model scores. If the model scores are not directionally accurate, or are predisposed towards a certain reviewer, the algorithm will not be able to accurately estimate the quality of the judges and the true labels.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrated two methods for combining multiple evaluators (human or LLM-as-Judge) utilizing GPT token logprobs and structured outputs capabilities. We showed a simple method for computing consensus agreement, and then also demonstrated an advanced multiannotator algorithm that can be used to estimate the quality of the judges and true labels. "
